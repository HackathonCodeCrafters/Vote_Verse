# 🔐 Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security policy and best practices for the **Web3 ICP Voting App**. The application is a decentralized voting system built on the Internet Computer (ICP) using smart contracts (canisters), Internet Identity for authentication, and follows strict principles of cryptographic integrity and user privacy.

---

## 🛡 Threat Model

The security model of this application considers the following potential threats:

- **Sybil Attacks**: Multiple identities used by a single entity to vote more than once.
- **Replay Attacks**: Re-use of previously valid requests or votes.
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Logic flaws, integer overflows, and improper state updates.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**: Attempts to exhaust resources on a canister or voting endpoint.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**: Attempts to intercept communications between users and the ICP frontend/backend.
- **Identity Spoofing**: Impersonation of users to cast unauthorized votes.

---

## ✅ Authentication & Identity

- Uses **Internet Identity (II)** from the Internet Computer for secure, password-less authentication.
- Each user session is **hardware-bound** (biometric or FIDO key) and device-specific.
- Sessions are **ephemeral** and privacy-preserving.
- Votes are tied to **anonymous but unique** principals from II, preventing double voting while preserving voter anonymity.

---

## 🧠 Smart Contract Security (Canisters)

- **Input validation** is enforced at the entrypoint level of each canister.
- Canisters are **stateless for vote casting** and store votes immutably.
- Votes are **hashed and signed** before submission to prevent tampering.
- **Upgrade paths** are controlled via governance mechanisms to avoid unauthorized code changes.
- Access control is applied to all administrative interfaces using II-based role checks.

---

## 🔒 Data Integrity & Privacy

- **No personal user data** (e.g., email, name) is stored—only anonymous principals.
- Votes are **end-to-end verifiable**, enabling public auditability without revealing voter identities.
- All communications are secured via **HTTPS and authenticated WebSocket** connections.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Audit

- The project includes **unit tests**, **integration tests**, and **property-based tests** using `dfx`, `motoko`, or `Rust`.
- Smart contracts undergo **manual code reviews** and use `cargo-audit` / `ic-metrics`.
- An **external audit** is planned before mainnet deployment.
